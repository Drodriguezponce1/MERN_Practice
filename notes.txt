Notes taken from resources (this may have grammer errors):

FOR EVERY TIME I RUN THIS PROJECT USE "npm run one"

1) npm install express mongoose dotenv was used
    * NPM is a javascript package manager

MongoDB - Database
Express - JS web app framework (where we make the APIs)
React - front end
Node - a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side


BACK END
2) installed a package called nodemon
    - this allows for me to not keep on turning off then on the server 

3) SQL vs MongoDB
    - tables vs collections
        - SQL based languages use tables while collections use BSON (key:value)

        - following the guide, looks like we can "clean" our code by having controllers and routers (I will mainly just do routers for now)

FRONT END
4) npm create vite@latest . was used to use a basic template from react
5) video showed https://chakra-ui.com/
