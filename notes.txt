Notes taken from resources (this may have grammer errors):

FOR EVERY TIME I RUN THIS PROJECT USE "npm run one"

1) npm install express mongoose dotenv was used
    * NPM is a javascript package manager

MongoDB - Database
Express - JS web app framework (where we make the APIs)
React - front end
Node - a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side

2) installed a package called nodemon
    - this allows for me to not keep on turning off then on the server
