# MERN_Practice
This is where I am practicing a MERN stack project (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)

Project Specifics:
- Use MongoDB to hold my personal collection of Manga, Music, Trading Cards, and Video Games

- I am using Express to make the endpoints for my API

- React is being used for the front-end portion of this project

- Lastly, Node is being used to host such a web application
